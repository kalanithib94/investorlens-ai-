## 🎯 If Something Doesn't Work:

### Backend Issues:
- Check Railway logs: Backend service → Deployments → View Logs
- Common fix: Make sure "Root Directory" is set to `backend`

### Frontend Issues:
- Check Vercel logs: Project → Deployments → View Function Logs
- Common fix: Make sure `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly

### Database Empty (No Companies):
Don't worry! You can add companies via the API docs:
1. Open: `YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/docs`
2. Find "POST /api/companies"
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Add a test company
