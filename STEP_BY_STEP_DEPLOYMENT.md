## üìû Troubleshooting

### Frontend shows "Backend connection unavailable"
**Fix:**
- Check CORS_ORIGINS in Railway includes your Vercel URL
- Verify VITE_API_URL in Vercel is correct
- Refresh both pages

### Backend shows errors in Railway logs
**Fix:**
- Check "Root Directory" is set to `backend`
- Verify DATABASE_URL exists (auto-created with PostgreSQL)
- Check all environment variables are set

### Can't see API docs
**Fix:**
- Make sure you're using `/docs` at the end of Railway URL
- Check backend deployment completed successfully
- Try `/health` first to verify backend is running
