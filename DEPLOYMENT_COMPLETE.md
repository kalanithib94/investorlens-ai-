- ✅ Monitors financial metrics 24/7
- ✅ Aggregates news and analyzes sentiment
- ✅ Generates alerts for critical issues

### **The Value:**
- **Time Saved**: 10+ hours/week → 30 minutes/week
- **Better Outcomes**: Catch problems 3-6 months earlier
- **Scalability**: Monitor 100+ companies as easily as 10
- **Data-Driven**: Remove gut feelings, use AI insights
