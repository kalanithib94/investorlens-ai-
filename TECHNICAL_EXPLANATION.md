- Claude is better for complex reasoning and risk assessment
- Demonstrates understanding of different LLM capabilities

**Interview Talking Point**: "I implemented a multi-model LLM architecture using both GPT-4 and Claude, choosing the best model for each use case. GPT-4 for summaries, Claude for risk assessment."

#### **Key AI Features Implemented**

1. **Automated Executive Summaries** (`llm_analyzer.py`)
```python
- Aggregates company data, metrics, and news
- Creates structured prompt with context
- Uses GPT-4 with temperature=0.3 for consistent analysis
- Returns actionable insights
```

2. **AI-Powered Risk Scoring** (`analysis.py`)
```python
- Analyzes runway, burn rate, ARR
- Considers existing alerts
- Calculates 0-100 risk score
- Generates risk mitigation recommendations
- Auto-creates alerts if risk > 75
```

3. **Competitive Intelligence**
```python
- Fetches industry/competitor news
- Analyzes market trends
- Identifies opportunities and threats
- Provides strategic recommendations
```

**Interview Talking Point**: "I built three major AI features: executive summaries, risk scoring, and competitive analysis. Each uses carefully crafted prompts and the appropriate LLM model."

#### **LLM Development Techniques Used**

- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts with clear instructions and context
- **Temperature Control**: Lower temperature (0.3) for consistent analytical output
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to mock data if API keys unavailable (for demo)
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking LLM calls using `async/await`
- **Cost Management**: Mock responses for development, real LLM for production

PATCH  /api/alerts/{id}/read      - Mark as read
PATCH  /api/alerts/{id}/resolve   - Resolve alert
GET    /api/alerts/stats/summary  - Alert statistics
```

**Interview Talking Point**: "I built a comprehensive RESTful API with 25+ endpoints, following REST principles: proper HTTP methods, status codes, and resource-based URLs."

#### **API Best Practices Implemented**

1. **Input Validation** (Pydantic)
```python
class CompanyCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=255)
    ownership_percentage: Optional[float] = Field(None, ge=0, le=100)
```

2. **Response Models**
```python
@router.get("/companies", response_model=List[CompanyResponse])
# FastAPI automatically validates and serializes responses
```

3. **Error Handling**
```python
if not company:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=404,
        detail=f"Company with id {company_id} not found"
    )
```

4. **Dependency Injection**
```python
async def list_companies(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Database session automatically managed
```

5. **Auto-Generated Documentation**
- Swagger UI at `/docs`
- ReDoc at `/redoc`
- OpenAPI schema auto-generated

**Interview Talking Point**: "I implemented API best practices including input validation with Pydantic, proper error handling, dependency injection, and automatic OpenAPI documentation generation."

- alert_type (enum: risk, opportunity, anomaly, news)
- severity (enum: low, medium, high, critical)
- title, description, ai_summary
- is_read, is_resolved, resolved_at
```

**Design Decisions**:
- **Foreign keys** for referential integrity
- **Indexes** on frequently queried fields (company_id, severity)
- **Timestamps** for audit trail
- **Soft deletes** (is_active flag) to preserve history
- **JSON fields** for flexible metadata

**Interview Talking Point**: "I designed a normalized relational database with three main tables: Companies, Metrics, and Alerts. Used foreign keys for relationships, indexes for performance, and soft deletes to preserve data."

## üé§ Practice Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: Walk me through the system architecture.**
**A**: "The system follows a three-tier architecture. The React frontend on Vercel makes REST API calls to the FastAPI backend on Railway. The backend has a service layer with AI engine, data aggregator, and alert services, all connecting to a PostgreSQL database. This separation allows for independent scaling and maintainability."

**Q: How does the AI risk scoring work?**
**A**: "The risk scoring combines quantitative metrics like runway and burn rate with qualitative AI analysis. I send company data to Claude via API, which analyzes multiple factors and returns a 0-100 risk score. If the score exceeds 75, I automatically create a high-severity alert. This demonstrates both algorithmic thinking and AI integration."

**Q: How would you handle increased traffic?**
**A**: "I'd implement several strategies: add Redis caching for frequently accessed data, use Celery for background processing of heavy AI tasks, implement database read replicas, add rate limiting, and use Railway's horizontal scaling. The service-based architecture already makes this easier."

**Q: What was the biggest technical challenge?**
**A**: "Integrating multiple external APIs reliably. I implemented retry logic, exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and graceful fallbacks. For example, if the news API is down, the system still works but returns mock data, ensuring the user experience isn't broken."

**Q: How did you ensure code quality?**
**A**: "I used Python type hints throughout, implemented comprehensive input validation with Pydantic, wrote unit and integration tests with pytest, set up proper error handling and logging, and followed PEP 8 style guidelines. The code is production-ready."
